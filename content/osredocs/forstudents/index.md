# How to apply to the OSRE

1. Take a look at [projects](/osre#projects)...
2. Between February 22 and March 19, contact mentor(s), send CV/resume, and tell them your motivation for wanting to work on this project. (You are strongly encouraged to propose to a maximum of two project proposals.)
3. Join slack channel. (contact  [OSRE Admins](ospo-info-group@ucsc.edu) for invitation). Note that we will only review projects of contributors who have also join our slack channel by March 20. Use this time to also get to know the project you are applying to work and the members of the project community. You are highly encouraged to ask questions. 
4. Be prepared to provide mentors some examples of your technical knowledge as an initial step. For instance, mentors may ask you to carry out a technical test or show work you have done in the past to assess your knowledge. This is an important for ensuring you are proposing something that this beneficial to you, the mentor and the community. We have project open to people with a wide range of skill levels and types so do not worry about "passing" the test - just show what your skill levels are and areas you are able to grow in.
5. Once you and the mentor have established your level of proficiency and how it fits within project ideas, you will collaborate on writing the proposal. 
The mentors will:
    - Guide you through project software
    - Discuss project objectives and how to achieve them. 
    - Provide pointers to documentation, reference research
Note that the mentor feedback period will typically run from March 20 to April 3. 
5. Proposal must contain:
    - Detailed plan of work with an estimate of the time needed (typically 175 or 375 hours in total.) See template below.
    - Well defined tasks and their objectives, list of deliverables
    - Note any committments that could impact the amount of time you can spend on the project.  
6. Proposal will be evaluated and ranked by mentors, feedback given to OSRE Admins. Results are made public May 4.


IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT FOR ALL ACCEPTED PROJECTS
OSRE contributors will be required to provide short weekly status updates. These will help the mentors and the OSRE Admins see that your project is on track. They are also meant to provide a basis for blog posts to be completed by the contributors and highlighted by the organization admins.
Mentors and OSRE Admins expect summer contributors to act professionally and respect the mentor's time and efforts. As with any professional setting, it is the responsibility of the contributor/student to inform their mentor if they will be taking any vacations or if they have any other obligation that conflicts with the proposed workplan. Not informing the mentor of these conflicts can result in removal from the program.
Contributors will be expected to attend all-hands and other group meetings throughout the program. These meetings will be via zoom and held at various times of day to allow participation for a wide range of time zones. 

Do not hesitate to contact  [OSRE Admins](ospo-info-group@ucsc.edu) for further questions.
