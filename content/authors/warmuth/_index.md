Kilian Warmuth is pursuing his M.Sc. in Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) after completing a B.Sc. in Computer Science at the same institution. He was involved in an interdisciplinary project where he created a testing toolchain for the packet generator MoonGen using the SCLICES/pos testbed. This experience provided him with extensive hands-on exposure to pos, increasing his interest in reproducible testbeds.
