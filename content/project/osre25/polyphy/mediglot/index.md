[PolyPhy](https://github.com/PolyPhyHub/PolyPhy) is a GPU oriented agent-based system for reconstructing and visualizing *optimal transport networks* defined over sparse data. Rooted in astronomy and inspired by nature, we have used an early prototype called [Polyphorm](https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/Polyphorm) to reconstruct the [Cosmic web](https://youtu.be/5ILwq5OFuwY) structure, but also to discover network-like patterns in natural language data. You can see an instructive overview of PolyPhy in our [workshop](https://elek.pub/workshop_cross2022.html) and more details about our research [here](https://elek.pub/projects/Rhizome-Cosmology).

The aim of this project is to refine and enhance Mediglot, a web application for visualizing 3D medicinal embeddings, which extends the Polyglot app and leverages the PolyPhy toolkit for network-inspired data science. Mediglot currently enables users to explore high-dimensional vector representations of medicines (derived from their salt compositions) in a 3D space using UMAP, as well as analyze similarity through the innovative Monte-Carlo Physarum Machine (MCPM) metric.
This year, the project focuses on exploring and integrating state-of-the-art AI techniques and algorithms to improve Mediglot's clustering capabilities and its representation of medicinal data in 3D. The contributor will experiment with advanced large language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge AI methods to develop innovative approaches for refining clustering and extracting deeper insights from medicinal embeddings. Additionally, the contributor is expected to evaluate and compare different algorithms to enhance the MCPM similarity visualization and its interpretability.
Specific tasks:
Closely work with the mentors on understanding the context of the project and its detailed requirements in preparation of the proposal.
Become acquainted with the tooling (PolyPhy, MediGlot) prior to the start of the project period.
Document the nature of the target dataset and define the complete data pipeline with assistance of the mentors, including the specific analytic tasks and objectives.
Implement the data pipeline in PolyPhy and MediGlot.
Document the process and resulting findings in a publicly available report.
