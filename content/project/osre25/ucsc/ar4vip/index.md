[Polyphorm](https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/Polyphorm) is an agent-based system for reconstructing and visualizing *optimal transport networks* defined over sparse data. Rooted in astronomy and inspired by nature, we have used Polyphorm to reconstruct the [Cosmic web](https://youtu.be/5ILwq5OFuwY) structure, but also to discover network-like patterns in natural language data. You can find more details about our research [here](https://elek.pub/projects/Rhizome-Cosmology). Under the hood, Polyphorm uses a richer 3D scalar field representation of the reconstructed network, instead of a discrete representation like a graph or a mesh.

**PolyPhy** will be a Python-based redesigned version of Polyphorm, currently in the beginning of its development cycle. PolyPhy will be a multi-platform toolkit meant for a wide audience across different disciplines: astronomers, neuroscientists, data scientists and even artists and designers. All of the offered projects focus on PolyPhy, with a variety of topics including design, coding, and even research. Ultimately, PolyPhy will become a tool for discovering connections between different disciplines by creating quantitatively comparable structural analytics.

### Develop website for PolyPhy

- **Topics:** `Web Development` `Dynamic Updates` `UX`
- **Skills:** web development experience, good communicator, (HTML/CSS), (Javascript)
- **Difficulty:** Moderate
- **Size:** Medium or large (175 or 350 hours)
- **Mentors:** [Oskar Elek](mailto:oelek@ucsc.edu)

Develop a clean and welcoming website for the project. The organization needs to reflect the needs of PolyPhy users, but also provide a convenient entry point for interested project contributors. No excessive pop-ups or webjunk.

Specific tasks:
- Work with mentors on understanding the context of the project.
- Port the contents of the [repository page](https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/Polyphorm) to a dedicated website.
- Design the structure of the website according to best OS practices.
- Work with the visual designer (see below) in creating a coherent and organic presentation.
- Interactively link important metrics from the project dev environment as well as documentation.

### Setup CI/CD for PolyPhy

- **Topics:** `Continuous Integration` `Continuous Deployment` `DevOps`
- **Skills:** experience with CI/CD, GitHub, Python package deployment
- **Difficulty:** Moderate
- **Size:** Large (350 hours)
- **Mentors:** [Oskar Elek](mailto:oelek@ucsc.edu), [Anisha Goel](mailto:anishagoel14@gmail.com)

The objective is to setup a CI/CD pipeline that automates the build testing and deployment of the software. The resulting process needs to be robust to contributor errors and work in the distributed conditions of a diverse contributor base.

Specific tasks:
- Automate continuous building, testing, merging and deployment for PolyPhy in GitHub.
- Publish the CI/CD metrics and build assets to the project webpage.
- Work with other contributors in educating them about the best practices of using the developed CI/CD pipeline.
- Add support for automated packaging using common management systems (pip, Anaconda).
