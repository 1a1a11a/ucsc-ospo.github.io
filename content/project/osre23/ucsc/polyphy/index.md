[PolyPhy](https://github.com/PolyPhyHub/PolyPhy) is a GPU oriented agent-based system for reconstructing and visualizing *optimal transport networks* defined over sparse data. Rooted in astronomy and inspired by nature, we have used an early prototype called [Polyphorm](https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/Polyphorm) to reconstruct the [Cosmic web](https://youtu.be/5ILwq5OFuwY) structure, but also to discover network-like patterns in natural language data. You can see an instructive overview of PolyPhy in our [workshop](https://elek.pub/workshop_cross2022.html) and more details about our research [here](https://elek.pub/projects/Rhizome-Cosmology).

Under the hood, PolyPhy uses a richer 3D scalar field representation of the reconstructed network, instead of a typical discrete representation like a graph or a mesh. The ultimate purpose of PolyPhy is to become a toolkit for a range of specialists across different disciplines: astronomers, neuroscientists, data scientists and even artists and designers. PolyPhy aspires to be a tool for discovering connections between different disciplines by creating quantitatively comparable structural analytics.

### Write PolyPhy's technical story and content

- **Topics:** `Writing` `Documentation` `Storytelling`
- **Skills:** experienced writing structured, well read, technical or scientific education, web development basics
- **Difficulty:** Moderate
- **Size:** 350 hours
- **Mentors:** {{% mention oelek %}}, [Ezra Huscher](mailto:ez@nmsu.edu)

Integral to PolyPhy's presentation is a story that the users and the project contributors can relate to. The objective is to develop the verbal part of that story, as well as major portions of technical documentation that matches it.

Specific tasks:
- Work with mentors on understanding the context of the project.
- Write and edit diverse pages of the project [website](https://www.polyphy.io).
- Work with mentors to improve project's written community practices (diversity, communication).
- Write and edit narrative and explanatory parts of PolyPhy's documentation.
- Create tutorials that present core functionality of the toolkit.
