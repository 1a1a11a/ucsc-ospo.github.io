Instructures for participating projects and mentors are [here](/osredocs/formentors). The main difference from last year ...

There is a mentor-only mailing list ... Please write us an email if you want to be added to this list.

For new research groups wishing to join OSRE: just add a description and and logo for your organization. Note that your project needs to
- EITHER have at least one mentor affiliated with one the UC campuses or associated DOE national labs
- OR have some connection to reproducibility in experimental computational systems.

We need one contact person for each new group, so please email us.
