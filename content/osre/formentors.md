The UCSC OSPO is looking for mentors to be part of our 2023 Open Source Research Experience Program (OSRE), which this year also includes a new initiative -- the Summer of Reproducibility (SoR). While typical OSRE supported projects require mentors who are connected to University of California-based open source projects, thanks to funding from the National Science Foundation, the Summer of Reproducibility allows us to also support any US-based mentors interested in working with students creating reproducibilty artifacts over the summer 

The goal of OSRE 2023 is to increase student capabilities in working in open source projects and creating reproducible artifacts, as well as add productive open source contributors and promote open source and reproducibility throughout the UC system and beyond.

The program team at UCSC OSPO values diversity and inclusion in all our projects. We invite mentors from groups traditionally excluded in computer science/open source communities to participate in this program.

Why should I be an OSRE mentor?
If you could use undergraduate research assistance over the summer with your on-going research, this is a great opportunity to get matched to top students. Like Google Summer of Code, the OSRE allows the mentors to choose the students they want to work with based on an interactive and iterative application process. The application process provides mentors the opportunity to select someone they want to work with who will benefit their project and research.

Who can be a mentor?

{{% callout note %}}
Your project needs to
- EITHER have at least one mentor affiliated with one the UC campuses or associated DOE national labs
- OR have some connection to producing or using reproducibility artifacts.
{{% /callout %}}

For OSRE open source supported projects: Any UC-affiliated faculty, researchers or graduate students working on projects that are or will ultimately be part of an open source community/ecosystem. (Note: All software created as part of an OSRE project must be released as free and open source under a license that is both approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and recognized as free by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).)

For Summer of Reproducibility: Researchers and faculty from any US-based organization looking to support the production or use of reproducibility artifacts.

What kind of projects are you accepting? Are there specific technologies or topics that you prefer?
The OSRE program supports projects in a wide range of open source communities. We have no requirement for the type of technology or aspects of the project being worked on, so long as it is or ultimately will be part of an open source project or community, or – in the case of SoR – result in reproducible artifacts

How do I submit a project / project idea?
Please read [the instructions](/osredocs/formentors) for participating mentors. In a change from the ideas page of previous years, we will feature each overarcing project on a separate page which will include all the relevent mentors' project ideas. Projects now use tags to associate with a particular year and whether it is a UC project or a reproducibility project (or both). More tags can be used to associate the project with a particular research area, e.g. chip design, storage systems, data science.

There is a mentor-only mailing list ... Please write us an email if you want to be added to this list.

For new research groups wishing to join OSRE: just create one or more projects (see [instructions](/osredocs/formentors)). 

We need one contact person for each new group, so please email us.
