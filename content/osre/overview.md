Inspired by [Google Summer of Code](https://cross.ucsc.edu/programs/gsoc_cross.html), the Center for Research in Open Source Software (CROSS) pioneered the Open Source Research Experience (OSRE) in the [summer of 2020](https://youtu.be/jXh-y3BQqbw), a marketplace for [open source project ideas](https://uccross.github.io/projects) that matches students to mentors, and engages members of industry to fund and participate in open source based summer internships. The goal of this program is to increase student capabilities in working in open source, add productive contributors to on-going projects, and further promote open source at UC Santa Cruz and other UC campuses. OSRE is now run by the OSPO to educate students by supporting their contribution to developer communities in open source projects and providing highly relevant open source experiences to undergrads.

> The benefits for industry partners and other interested sponsors include the identification of potential recruits, the encouragement of open source practices in academic research, and early access to technologies in research prototypes.  
The benefits for participating mentors include the opportunity to attract and support talented student developers to their open source community.  
The benefits for participating students include the opportunity to work with mentors who are genuinely interested in outcomes and exposure to technologies that can significantly improve their job opportunities.

**The OSPO values diversity and inclusion in all of our projects.** We invite students from traditionally excluded groups in tech and open source communities to apply to this program. Contributions are welcomed from both UC Santa Cruz and non-UC Santa Cruz students. The OSPO is partnering with the Baskin Engineering [Inclusive Excellence Hub](https://ieh.soe.ucsc.edu/inclusive-excellence-hub) to increase our ability to reach a more diverse pool of students and mentors.

OSRE accepts [project ideas](https://uccross.github.io/projects) from researchers at the University of California at any of the affiliated national labs (LANL, LBL, LLNL). All projects must be open source to be considered for this program. See information for interested mentors below. 

Industry partners and other sponsors are welcome to support this program by [indicating their interest in particular project idea portfolios](https://uccross.github.io/projectstolike). Sponsors support is used directly to fund these student summer internships. OSRE mentors will invite sponsoring organizations to participate in a blend of open source software strategies with graduate-level research in a concentrated environment of mentorship, including the opportunity to meet and interact with students and mentors, and an invitation to an end-of-summer presentation where they will show off the results of their work.

An overview of the sponsorship framework for the 2021 summer program is [available](https://cross.ucsc.edu/programs/sponsorinformation.html#video). The 2022 framework is available [here](https://cross.ucsc.edu/2022-osre/osre2022sponsor.html).
