Machine learning models often decline in effectiveness over time due to environmental changes, known as drift. As part of the [Developing A Comprehensive Pipeline to Benchmark Drift Management Approaches](/project/osre24/anl/last), I aim to develop an extensible pipeline that evaluates and benchmarks the strengths and weaknesses of various state-of-the-art drift management algorithms, under the mentorship of [Ray Andrew](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/author/ray-andrew-sinurat/)  and [Sandeep Madireddy](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/author/sandeep-madireddy/) throughout the summer. This is my [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1biPUKMiKrNSegPVFDIyhjKkYeyiyD4hYqQghdsaU4IE/edit?usp=sharing) for this project.

This final deliverable of this pipeline will be packaged into a Chameleon Trovi Artifact. The pipeline will be made easily extensible to cater to additional datasets or any custom-made drift-mitigation methods.
