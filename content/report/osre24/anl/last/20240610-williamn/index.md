Hello everyone!

I'm William Nixon, a 3rd year computer science student enrolled at Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), Indonesia. I have a keen interest in machine learning within the systems context.

Machine learning models often decline in effectiveness over time due to environmental changes, known as drift. As part of the [Developing A Comprehensive Pipeline to Benchmark Drift Management Approaches](/project/osre24/anl/last) project tackling this, I aim to develop an extensible pipeline that evaluates and benchmarks the strengths and weaknesses of various state-of-the-art drift management algorithms. I will fortunately be under the mentorship of [Ray Andrew](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/author/ray-andrew-sinurat/)  and [Sandeep Madireddy](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/author/sandeep-madireddy/) throughout the summer. This is my accepted [proposal] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1biPUKMiKrNSegPVFDIyhjKkYeyiyD4hYqQghdsaU4IE/edit?usp=sharing).

This pipeline will be packaged into a Chameleon Trovi Artifact to facilitate reproducibility and extension of the work. The pipeline will be made flexible to be extended to other different datasets or custom-made drift-mitigation methods. 

Stay tuned as we explore the future of drift management in machine learning!
