The UCSC OSPO Open Source Research Experience (OSRE) Program is excited to announce that our mentors will work with 17 student contributors this summer. This includes 14 contributors sponsored by the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) under the Center for Research in Open Source Software (CROSS) mentor organization. Aside from GSoC, OSRE sponsors this year include Toshiba America Electronic Components, and Baskin Engineering Inclusive Excellence Hub (IEH), and CITRIS. 

This is the most students to be supported by the OSRE program since its inception in 2020, and almost doubles the number of OSRE students in 2021. Most notably, the number of GSoC contributor slots is nearly triple the slots awarded to CROSS in 2021. This significant increase in GSoC support is in large part due to the expansion of the OSRE to include mentors from other UC campuses and affiliated labs. This year the OSRE is excited to include 18 mentors who include researchers and faculty from three UC campuses (Santa Cruz, Riverside, and San Diego) as well one UC-run lab (Lawrence Berkeley National Lab). All these mentors are involved with UC-based open source projects and ecosystems. 

OSRE mentors posted project ideas for contributors on the Project Ideas page in early 2022 and began advising interested contributors in February. Interested students/contributors submitted their project proposals in April and slots were announced on May 19. The CROSS/OSPO organization administrators received 53 applications this year through the GSoC portal â€“ a 33% increase from the 2021 application pool. 

Student contributors begin working on their projects in mid-June, ending in late August/ early September. All summer contributors will be asked to present their work at the Open Source Research Symposium scheduled to take place in late September 2022 (in-person at UC Santa Cruz as well as remote.) The OSPO will also be highlighting the work of these contributors throughout the summer, so come back to check out the progress.
